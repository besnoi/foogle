One of the most complicated piece of software is a search engine! The very basis of a search engine is that there's a database and you search something in that database and results are laid out in the most logical format! Google is the most complicated search engine on planet and shows results based on a user's preferences like location,language,etc!

Foogle is however a much simpler version of Google - perhaps not even 1% but it has all the basic features that one might expect from a search engine like showing most relevant results in the top, images in a masonry, a pagination system (and maybe an infinite scroll for images).
